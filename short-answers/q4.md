# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
Use `.innerHTML` to good when dealing with small changes  on a HTML element. if you need to change a few lines of text then use `.innerHTML`. It is also used to template specific html elements.
Use `.createElement` for better performance on bigger code blocks. It doesn't  use event listeners like `.innerHTML` and can be used to control everything in a program. It is also used to create dynamic elements with dynamic content.
