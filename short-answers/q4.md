# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
Use `.innerHTML` to write easy stuff. Use `.createElement` for better performance on bigger code blocks.

# Teacher Feedback

Uhm not quite, I think your first sentence is a bit opinionated. When should we be using `.innerHTML` in comparison to `.createElement`? What is easy stuff? Feel free to give an analogy or example!
