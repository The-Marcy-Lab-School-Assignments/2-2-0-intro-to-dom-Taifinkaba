# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
Use `.innerHTML` to good when dealing with small changes  on a HTML element. if you need to change a few lines of text then use `.innerHTML`.
Use `.createElement` for better performance on bigger code blocks. It doesn't  use event listeners like `.innerHTML` and can be used to control everything in a program. 

# Teacher Feedback

Uhm not quite, I think your first sentence is a bit opinionated. When should we be using `.innerHTML` in comparison to `.createElement`? What is easy stuff? Feel free to give an analogy or example!
