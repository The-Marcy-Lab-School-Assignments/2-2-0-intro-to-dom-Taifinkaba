# Question
What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer
`.innerText` return exactly whats typed. It ignores HTML tags and doesn't include text that is hidden with CSS styles. `.textContent` returns whats typed but excludes some of the elements. It reads text as it is in the markup and returns all text, without having it  to render on screen.
